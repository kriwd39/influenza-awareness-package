### Post 1 (with image suggestion)
**Headline:** Time for Your Flu Shot!
**Body:** Influenza season is approaching. The flu vaccine is your best defense against getting sick and spreading the virus to others. It's quick, safe, and recommended for everyone 6 months and older. Visit your local clinic or pharmacy to get protected. #FluShot #HealthyCommunity #Prevention

### Post 2 (educational)
**Headline:** How Does Flu Spread?

### Post 3 (myth busting)
**Headline:** Myth: The flu vaccine can give you the flu.
**Body:** FALSE. Flu vaccines are made with inactivated viruses or a single protein, so they cannot cause influenza. Some people may experience mild side effects like soreness or low fever, but that's a sign your immune system is responding—not flu illness. Get the facts, get protected. #MythBuster #VaccineSafety
