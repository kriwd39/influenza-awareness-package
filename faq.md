# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) - Seasonal Influenza

## General Information

### What is influenza (flu)?
Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to hospitalization or death.

### How does flu spread?
Flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes.

### What are the symptoms of flu?
Symptoms can include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children).

## Vaccination

### Why should I get a flu vaccine?
Annual flu vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from flu and its potentially serious complications. Vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, doctor visits, missed work and school, and prevent flu-related hospitalizations.

### When should I get vaccinated?
It is recommended to get vaccinated before flu begins spreading in your community, ideally by the end of October. However, vaccination later in the season can still be beneficial.

### Can the flu vaccine give me flu?
No, flu vaccines cannot cause flu illness. The viruses in flu vaccines are either inactivated (killed) or attenuated (weakened), so they cannot cause infection.

### Is the flu vaccine safe?
Yes, flu vaccines have a good safety record. Hundreds of millions of people have safely received flu vaccines over many decades.

### How effective is the flu vaccine?
Flu vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and depends on factors such as the match between vaccine viruses and circulating viruses, and the age and health of the person vaccinated. On average, flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by 40% to 60% among the overall population during seasons when vaccine viruses are well matched.

## Prevention & Treatment

### What can I do to prevent flu?
- Get vaccinated every year.
- Avoid close contact with sick people.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water.
- Cover your coughs and sneezes.
- Stay home when you are sick.

### What should I do if I get sick?
Stay home, rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid contact with others. Most people with mild illness recover without medical care. If you are at higher risk of serious flu complications, contact your healthcare provider early.

### Are there treatments for flu?
Yes, antiviral drugs can be prescribed by a healthcare provider to treat flu illness. These drugs work best when started within 48 hours of symptoms beginning.
